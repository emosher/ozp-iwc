##Setup
Using bower, the IWC client can be gathered with the following:

`bower install ozone-development/ozp-iwc`

To add the client module to an application, include the ozpIwc-client.min.js script from the dist directory.

`<script src="../bower_components/ozp-iwc/dist/js/ozpIwc-client.js"></script>`


A pre-configured example bus is hosted at `http://ozone-development.github.io/iwc` for demonstrative purposes.
See [connecting](connecting.md) for connecting a client to the bus.

To use a configured IWC bus, refer to the [IWC deployment guide](../iwc_backend_integration_guide/README.md).
An example configured bus is provided with the distributed IWC via github.
